# Logos Personal Study Bible .docx

Welcome to the personalized Bible translation for seminarians and students using the Logos Bible software! This translation is designed to help you engage with the original biblical texts in a deeper and more meaningful way, and to support your study and exploration of the Bible as you progress in your academic and spiritual journey. By utilizing a public domain Bible, pastors and teachers can make modifications and then use their personal study Bible without copyright infringement.

The Logos Bible software is a powerful tool that allows you to access a wealth of resources, including biblical texts in their original languages, commentaries, and other scholarly works. With the ability to create customized reading plans, notes, and highlights, Logos provides a unique platform for studying and interacting with the Bible.

This personalized Bible translation takes advantage of the features and capabilities of Logos, allowing you to make modifications to the text as you study, and to create your own notes, annotations, and insights. Whether you are a seminarian, a student, or a lifelong learner, this translation provides a flexible and dynamic resource for your exploration of the Bible.

The translation itself is based on rigorous scholarship and careful attention to the original languages of the Bible. The goal is to provide a clear and accurate rendering of the biblical text, while also retaining the richness and complexity of the original.

We encourage you to use this personalized Bible translation as a tool for your own study and reflection, and to make it your own by adding your own insights and reflections as you engage with the text. We hope that this translation will help you deepen your understanding of the Bible, and support you in your journey of faith and learning.

I am not a pastor. I am a software engineer who loves Jesus, and I delight in the instruction of Yahweh.[^ps1] My self-directed study eventually led me to taking classes online toward a Masters of Biblical Studies, leading a small group, teaching at my church, becoming an elder at my church, praying for my coworkers, and writing the software to generate this document. May it serve you well.

This introduction is primarily here to help guide you in how to utilize this as a tool. I am still discovering it myself, but here is what I have learned so far.

## Why make your own translation?
Pastors may make their own translations of the Bible for a variety of reasons. Here are a few possible reasons:

1. To better understand the original languages: By creating their own translation, pastors may gain a deeper understanding of the original languages of the Bible (Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic). Translating the text themselves allows them to engage with the nuances and complexities of the original languages in a way that is not possible with a pre-existing translation.
2. To address theological or doctrinal concerns: Pastors may create their own translation to address specific theological or doctrinal concerns. For example, if they feel that a particular translation does not accurately reflect their understanding of a particular biblical passage, they may create their own translation to better align with their beliefs.
3. To communicate the text in a modern context: Pastors may create their own translation to communicate the biblical text in a way that is more accessible to a modern audience. This may involve using contemporary language or cultural references that help readers understand the text in a new way.
4. To create a personalized resource: Creating a personalized translation allows pastors to tailor the text to their own needs and preferences. They may include additional notes, commentary, or insights that are specific to their own ministry or congregation.
5. To gain a deeper understanding of the text: Translating the text themselves allows pastors to engage with the biblical text in a deeper and more meaningful way. By wrestling with the language and meaning of the text, they may gain new insights and understandings that can inform their preaching and teaching.

In my own studies, I have had a few specific instances where I wanted to create and maintain my own version. When I was studying Psalm 1, I wanted to use the word "felon" instead of "wicked" to convey some of the implications of the Hebrew word. So many of the Hebrew words in Psalm 1 circle the imagery of a path, and the translations I used were faithful to the literal meaning or idea, but they all lacked the wordplay and symbolism swirling around the journey.

Names in the Bible also interest me. In American English, very few names have a meaning also in English with a few notable exceptions: Joy, Patience, Hunter. We claim that our names have meanings, but they are in different languages and require translation and explanation. Most often, they are simply forgotten. Jesus' name meant salvation in the language they spoke daily! How differently would we read the Bible if names were translated as well? Having a personal translation would afford such a thought experiment: "So God-Hearer took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and the Spirit of the Yahweh rushed on Beloved from that day forward" ([1 Sa 16:13](https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleCSB2.1Sa16.13)).

## Adding this doc as a Bible in Logos
Creating a personal book in Logos from a docx file is a simple process that can be done in a few easy steps. Here's how you can create a personal book in Logos using a docx file:

1. Open the Logos Bible Software program and navigate to the "Tools" menu on the top menu bar. Select "Personal Books" from the drop-down menu.
2. In the Personal Books tool, click the "Add book" button to create a new book.
3. In the "Add book" dialog box, select "New file" and browse to the location of your docx file on your computer. Select the file and click "Open."
4. In the "Add book" dialog box, you will be asked to provide some basic information about the book you are creating, such as the title, author, and publication date. You can also choose the type of book you are creating, such as Bible commentary or devotional.
5. Once you have filled in the required information, click "Build book" to begin the process of importing the content of your docx file into Logos. Depending on the length and complexity of the file, this process may take a few minutes.
6. Once the import process is complete, you will be able to access your personal book in the Logos program. You can search, highlight, and take notes on your personal book just like any other resource in Logos.

That's it! By following these simple steps, you can easily create a personal book in Logos from a docx file and integrate it into your study and research in Logos.

After you modify the docx, you may be required to close and re-open Logos before selecting "build book" again from the same file.

## Making sense of all the notations
Fields and milestones are two important features of Logos personal books that allow you to create rich and interactive resources for your study and research. Here's a brief overview of how fields and milestones work in Logos personal books.

Fields are the building blocks of personal books in Logos. A field is a piece of data or information that you add to your personal book, such as a title, author, or Bible reference. Fields can be added to your personal book using special codes called field codes, which are inserted into your text using curly braces {}.

The primary use of fields in this document is the {{bible-on/off}} field used to indicate when text is biblical text or not (like commentary, chapter numbers, etc).

There are many different types of fields you can add to your personal book, including author, title, description, subject, and more. Here is a link to the [Logos documentation](https://wiki.logos.com/Personal_Books#Fields) on the Fields.

Milestones are another important feature of personal books in Logos. A milestone is a specific point or location in your personal book that has special significance or functionality. For example, a Bible reference is a type of milestone that allows you to link directly to a specific Bible passage in Logos.

The primary use of of milestones in this document is the Bible reference milestone that allows Bible passage searching to function just like a normal Bible. Here is a link to the [Logos documentation](https://wiki.logos.com/Personal_Books#Milestones) on the Milestones.

## Footnotes and links
Feel free to utilize Logos notes, highlights, and linking. In addition to those, you can add footnotes and links inside the document. In this introduction, I have demonstrated several external links, an [internal link](https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleCSB2.Ps1.2), and a footnote.



[^ps1]: [Psalm 1](https://ref.ly/logosref/BibleCSB2.Ps1.2)
